2,Great location - otherwise disappointing,Chris,"We had read lots of the reviews of this hotel on here, and knew that this was not going to be a 5-star luxury experience, but that the location was ideal for sight-seeing.  This was indeed true - seconds off Times Square and right at the heart of things in NYC. But even though I expected cheap and cheerful, I was still disappointed with the hotel.  The rooms are seriously in need of renovation - to the extent that they are probably impossible to keep clean because the fixtures are so old. The bizarre 70s brown and green colour scheme makes the room feel musty and grimy, and the walls in our room were grazed and knocked. The carpet seemed to have layers of grime around the edges, the scratchy blanket and cover on the bed had long stray hairs included, and the bathroom had black…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisa313131
2,A lot to be desired,MARK M,"First, the positive. Convenient location and a friendly and accommodating  housekeeping staff that promptly responded to a couple of routine requests. Otherwise, not so good. The Queen bed sloped sharply on both sides towards the middle; the bathroom was in major need of retileing and the lines at lobby checkout and check-in were longer than the line outside ""Hello, Dolly."" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). Overall, not a good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6517RBmarkm
2,Mediocre at best,canadianhockey91,"Check in staff were friendly. The rooms were clean. The beds are very firm and not all that comfortable for a supposedly high end hotel. That wasn't the biggest issue.   The wait staff at the bar or the single server we had was exceptionally terrible. While asking what we wanted to drink I asked what types of of bourbon he had and he said it was in the menu. I stated it was not. He then ran off and came back 10min later to ask again. This time I showed him the menu that had nothing and he said oh wrong menu, I then asked for the correct one and he said sorry we don't have it then did not even ask if we wanted a drink again.   While that is an isolated incident I found it incredible unprofessional.   The location is very good. Right beside Grand Central and easily accessible.

1,Do NOT stay here!!! ,claire o,"I have just returned from an amazing 4 night trip in New York but unfortunately the hotel was a huge disappointment!  The main issue at this hotel being rude front of desk staff! From the moment we arrived we had various issues which were made 10 x worse than they needed to be by the front desk & how they spoke to us. The hotel isn’t cheap so I would expect a basic level of service but it simply did not exist. The only 2 members of staff that actually made a difference was Herbert & Miss Henry (& we thank you for that!)  The rooms were old, dated & the first room we was given was so small you could hardly move, we asked to move room which we did after lots of heated discussions & managed to get a better room.

I usually do not comment on hospitality service, as I like to think of myself as someone who's not very demanding-- I'm usually and easily pleased, and I don't ask for much, if at all. I only note when I feel that there has been an indelible deficiency. Perhaps they're overworked or understaffed that particular night (11 January), but I felt that the staff at the front desk at the time that I checked in (around 9.30pm on a busy evening) did not provide me with a particularly warm welcome, as they seemed impatient. They were certainly not impolite (and neither was I), but I felt uncomfortably rushed for no reason, as if I was a nuisance instead of a guest.

This is not true NY.   If you like waiting 20 minutes for an elevator, walking in crowds of thousands and looking at bright lights and stores you can find in any suburban mall, this is the place for you.

On arrival the check in was really too long with only 2 people manning the desks but i had been warned by colleagues to expect this. Once in the room (tip:get in the right elevator as left and right sides don't go to the same floors) it seemed spacious enough. After a long haul flight i was a bit thirsty so i looked for a bottle of water. There were none. So i opened the mini bar which was empty...first disappointment.

2,This was probably a classic hotel once...,Rasmus H,"I had one night at the New Yorker when I unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in New York City. At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).  The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"".

We went to the 8th floor to have some light lunch and coffee. The place is not fancy and the food is so so. They charged way too high for this kind of quality of  service and food.

It's very dark when you walk in and trying to find the right check in desk when tired after a long flight was interesting.  On checking in we were offered at upgrade at 100 dollars a night but thought it would be better just to stick with what we had booked. Check in was ok but the receptionist didn't explain the facilities in the hotel or even how to get to our room or even what room number we were. Never had this before anywhere else in the world.

My family had just stayed in a 4 star in Washington DC, the service was perfect, the room facilities were excellent, coffee machine etc., and the room had plenty of space.   In contrast the New Yorker had very poor service, the desk couldn't get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him. We were charged $20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin. Even though we had the rooms we booked in Washington the New Yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin.

However, after one month, there was a charge on my credit card from the hotel, stating that I checked in the Hotel in September, whereas, I reside in the Netherlands.

On arrival we checked in without issue but when we got to the room found mold in the shower and the room phone not working.  We returned from a day around the city and needed a cork screw so I asked the concierge for one.  He stated that they could not give me one but I had to call room service for this to be brought to our room, he could not do this for me.  I went to the room and attempted to call on both phones in the room but could not get a dial tone to get room service.

The rooms are old, dark, dusty and noisy. The bathroom is small and I had inconsistent hot water there. It felt like I was in a 1980s/early 90s four star hotel, which unfortunately, has been ignored since then. If this was $150 per night, perhaps I would consider it but at the $250-300 price that is often quoted here, there are many other better options in New York.

When we finally reached the front desk, they sent a staff to check the  room and discovered that there were no sofa beds among the 4 sofas. He said that they must have changed the furnitures. When I requested rollaway beds, I was told that there were none available as I did not order any.  When I asked where the other 2 adults would sleep as indicated in the booking, they suggested using the sofas and that they would sent sheets up. Housekeeping dropped off sheets, no pillows.

I'm Titanium Elite which tells you I've stayed in a lot of Marriott locations. I can't help but think of their great commercials that demonstrate thoughtful hospitality. Such a ruse. This hotel is so busy they have no motivation to be kind or hospitable to guests especially during the holidays. The staff is rude and abrasive and makes no effort to accommodate. As well during the holidays they close the concierge lounge and open the 5th floor ballroom which has more space. But they keep the 30th floor lounge closed and you can't go in and get water.

They ask you to pay $240 ($30/room/night) to go from your standard booking to a DELUXE.  You immediately agree and it is taken care of…..  You call again a second time, just to be sure all is OK and give them your arrival time and ask that they ensure you have two delux renovated rooms.

After several phone calls, they agreed to refund my $199 down payment. That was January 7.

First, the room we were provided for a family of four was inadequate. It is pokey, hot and stuffy and very noisy, and if you run the air conditioning it is too loud.

Apparently, it was announced in 2019 that this property was set for demolition. Then, during the heights of covid, NYC passed a law that made it expensive for this property (and others) to lay off its staff, so they paused demolition plans and rebranded to a standard Hyatt.

I understand why it is downgraded from Grand Hyatt to Hyatt, but even calling it a Hyatt Place will be too much.  There is still no indoor restaurant so dining is limited to an overpriced but underwhelming “New York Deli”.  Sit-down breakfast is simply not an option because there is no on-site restaurant at all, and based on this point, this hotel should not be branded as “Hyatt” at all.

When I saw a rat in the executive lounge on my last night there wasn’t even anyone around to report it to. So I called the customer service line when I got back to my room and the blasé reaction and almost a sigh, told me that this is probably a regular occurrence. There was a half hearted “sorry about that” thrown in as an after thought. No one bothered to follow-up. Just as well I was leave next morning.

1,I find myself forced to re-evaluate my opinion of the Hilton brand,James G,"After staying here for five nights over Thanksgiving week, I find myself forced to re-evaluate my assessment of what the Hilton brand stands for. I don't even know where to begin with my disappointment in my stay. My reservation was screwed up on their end, and they refused to correct it. The assistant director of operations that I spoke to was unprofessional, border on insulting, and completely unhelpful. I was promised three times that the director of operations would contact me to discuss my problems, but now, a week after checkout, I have not heard from them. The rest of the staff were superficially friendly and helpful, but seemed powerless to accomplish anything. The rooms themselves were very disappointing. The furnishings and decor seemed old and out of date. If you had…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/botulus

2,Absolute chaos - stay away,Boeing767,"We used 45000 points, PLUS an additional $70 for an ""upgrade"". This hotel is not worth it, we could have stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan or another similar hotel for less than $200 per night. Times Square is noisy, chaotic and crowded ... which one expects. What one DOES NOT expect is a hotel lobby which continues the problem. One expects a hotel lobby to be serene and tranquil (see number of reviews - and all I ask for is service). You have to take an elevator to the 8th floor to check in (3 minute wait for very crowded elevator), then once checked in, there is no assistance in finding a room.  For the relative expense (yes I know they were points - but I spent a great deal earning them), the room was a disappointment.

There was no complimentary coffee or tea. I mentioned this at the reception and they replied it must have been an oversight.

They told me that the “Taxes” include a $25 per night destination charge (plus taxes on that charge). I showed them the web site and pointed out that these destination charges are included in the line simply labeled “Taxes”, not Taxes & (Other) Fees. I expressed that this was a clear misrepresentation and thus I requested that either, the destination fees be waived, or I be allowed to cancel my reservation for a full refund without financial consequence to me. They refused to do either. They told me that I needed to dispute this with Hotels.com.

Walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors.  Also I must have called the operator on 5 different occasions,  and there was no answer.  I asked for directions at the  information desk and was treated pretty rudely. Checkout was unfriendly also. The hotel was not cheap  , I was expecting at least a 2 star place.

Elevators are slow and packed with people. There are signs everywhere that elite members get free breakfast but did not indicate it was for gold and platinum only. Never again.

Apparently housekeeping believed our souvenirs were trash. Newsflash. Things on the counter aren’t trash just because they’re made of paper. On our final day we went down for breakfast. Mistake. 2 people for buffet = $96! Food was cold and not fresh. Would have been better off with McDonalds. Seems also they jacked the prices of the rooms up because it was nba draft week.

They call them Queen size but beware they are only Four Foot wide!  Could hardly sleep even though we were exhausted after train journey. Complained too reception but was told all the rooms had the same size beds which we found hard to believe.

Our room on the 32nd floor was nice - spacious, comfortable, etc. But it lacked a refrigerator (standard in so many hotels now) and NO COFFEE? Say what? NO COFFEE in the room. I can't recall the last hotel I stayed in where there wasn't coffee in the room. Our traveling partners paid the same amount for a room with a ""King"" bed, which ended up being a queen (if that) in a teeny tiny room. It felt like a college dorm.

Now, the lobby is a dark, stark silhouette of years past. I have been going to this property since 1988. During that time, the hotel provided morning coffee in a pot, on a tray with cup/saucer and a newspaper delivered with your wake-up call to your room. Since New York is famous for their decorative windows during the holidays, this property previously decorated masterfully. One year, Mr. Jay Pritzker-owner hired a team that decorated the lobby below like the Dance of The Sugar Plum Fairies.

The hallways and the rooms were very much in need of remodeling. When I opened the bed my bed sheet was dirty and I placed a note to have the bed sheets replaced. There was no coffee machine in the room, but there was a fridge. There was no breakfast buffet available at the hotel and the restaurants on the main floor were poor quality.

3,Grand Hyatt Going Downhill,Mitch K.,"I stay here frequently as my company is next door; if it wasn't for that I would avoid this hotel. I've never once been offered the concierge floor, and the rooms are showing their age. As an example, the chair in the room was so worn I didn't even want to use it, and the light switches are maddeningly frustrating. There's no coffee maker in the room so you have to spend close to $5 for a 'large' coffee in their cafe which is actually a medium, and the elevators can be very slow. I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo and the difference between the two is striking, absolutely striking.

3,Great Location / Average Room,Michael G,"My family and I stayed here July 20-23, 2017 for a long weekend trip to NYC.  If Times Square or the theater district is your thing, this location can’t be beat as most of the theaters are within 2-3 blocks of your hotel.  The rooms are your basic Marriott room with NYC pricing – our room had two “queen” beds which were really full size beds, so be prepared if you are bringing a family – and are showing as a bit dated and need of an upgrade.  The elevators take quite a while to respond and are usually packed, so plan ahead if you are trying to get somewhere in a hurry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpgallagher2007

One major inconvenience is there is no coffee making facilities in the rooms and to get two coffees in the lobby is 10 dollars, not to mention having to get dressed and go on down! The lifts were busy but we never waited more that a couple minutes. We were in a room next to the service lifts and you could hear them whizzing up and down but that did not bother me!

3,Too Many Other Great Marriott Properties,Jon C,"Time has passed the Marquis by.  Great location and nice staff.  Lifetime Platinum Marriott so I go out of my way to stay at Marriotts. Hotel is way too big for the infrastructure. Hotel is a little tired and has odd smells.  Waiting on the elevator is a gigantic pain at various times of the day.  Room was nice size and had a neat view Times Square.  Lounge on 30th floor tried hard but crowds were overwhelming. Nothing on the weekend for elite but nothing on website just the BS 1000 points. Almost seems like they know they have a captive audience because of location.

3,Great staff and location; basic rooms,anchmer,"I’ve stayed at this property multiple times, and I appreciate the comfort and consistency of what you get. The staff are incredibly friendly (shout out to the cleaning staff on the 29th floor, as well as the breakfast team!), the location is great, and the rooms are quiet.  What’s not ideal is the cost of the amenities/shops, and the rooms need a bit of TLC. Our room, for example, would not cool down even though the AC was set to like 67 and it had a broken curtain pull. And although most don’t come to NYC to watch TV, an actual guide to what’s on (versus just the channel label) would be good.  And, please put a coffee/tea maker in the room so we don’t have to pay like $5 for a cuppa every morning!  I will still be back tough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anchmer
3,My First Visit,AJP57,"First, let me say that Hilton has some nice properties but it's not my preferred hotel chain.  I was here for business and it wasn't cheap.  I had requested an early check-in of 9am which wasn't available which I understand can't be guaranteed.  What I didn't understand is that they have no system of notifying guests when the room becomes available.  This was disturbing to me because I didn't want to return from work late at night and have difficulty getting my room.  I called back myself after lunch to find my room was available.  My experiences have been that hotels will take your phone number and call you back when your room is ready.  This is a mega hotel with over 1,900 rooms and it's also a magnet for school groups.

Be prepared to wait up to 20 minutes for a ride.  My advice is to avoid floors 28-38.   -The hotel was full, but staffing appears to be Covid level, so housekeeping and concierge services are understaffed. -We stayed in a suite.

The Doormen, three of them, just watched us unload our own luggage and trying to negotiate our way into the hotel. No hello or interaction. Concierge shuts down after 10PM (in a city that never sleeps!).   The Front Desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating; the housekeeping staff was warm, friendly and forthcoming.

We found the check in process very long and unorganized. To get a ""ball drop"" view it was going to cost an additional $5,000. I get that but it's a bit extreme.

After nearly 25 minutes in line, the front desk then told me our room was not ready without any indication of what time it would be. They would ""call me"" when it was available.

I kept asking for a better room with a bathroom I could move around in.  Finally on my 3rd night I got a receptive person at the front desk who asked if I was willing to pay for an upgrade.

3,Luxury hotel devolving into a reasonable budget option,Ken F,"We've stayed at this hotel many times over the years. My understanding is that the Hyatt Grand Central New York is slated for demolition in the near future, which means that a hotel that previously set a standard for luxury is slowly mutating into the walking dead -- it looks and feels like a hotel that knows well its ultimate fate. Nonetheless, the Hyatt Grand Central New York has transformed itself into a reasonable and well-located budget option.   Good points: for wintertime travelers with an active schedule that involves mass transit, the location couldn't be better. It directly connects to the trains and subways of Grand Central Station.

Even late at night waits of 5 minutes were not uncommon.  It was so bad on the day I arrived that the system stopped working and I had to use the stairs.  This is an issue when you are on the 42nd floor!  The internet was slow and intermittent with no way to get high speed access in the room.

One lady, in the foyer sorting out the Beetlejuice merchandise was one of the rudest people I've ever encountered in my life.

Given that it's also a popular conference location with multiple floors of ghastly conference rooms, it can be forgiven for being heavily used by tourists and business-types alike. The room was basic, but I was turned off by the soiled shower ceiling from a leak above, and the very basic bathroom amenities did nothing to delight. Pulverized toilet paper lingered in the bowl after each flush, perhaps a water-saving mechanism.

When we checked in the lady said she would give us a free upgrade to one of the newly renovated floors higher up. I dread to think what the un-renovated floors were like. The room (3034) looked tired and well used, there was no view as the room looked over to another room, the room was very small.

The hotel is in a decent location. It was absolutely packed with guests and, frankly, seemed understaffed. The bar has last call at 11:30pm due to quote “decline in business due to the pandemic”. Plenty of patrons were turned away last night shortly after 11:30. The thing that really got me was there were virtually no amenities for diamond members.

Bathroom has been upgraded at some stage from the usual hotel tub to a walk in shower, but is still really cramped. Checkout would have taken for ages as they only had two people at the reception at noon. Thankfully you could do just a key drop and get your bill electronically.

3,Average hotel.  Overpriced for service level and amenities,International Traveler,"I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York a few times over the past few years the most recent being last weekend.  For paying almost 400 per night and being a Grand Hyatt, its decidedly mediocre.   The service attitude of staff starting with Bellman outside to the check in staff is pretty awful.  Doorman didn't offer to take my bags upstairs, there was no bellman and elevator was impossible to find and no one was there directing traffic.  There a limited number of check in counters and there always seems to one that is closed despite having people at the desk.  The attittude of the front desk is more reminiscent of a basic Hyatt Place hotel rather than a 5 star Grand Hyatt.  The rooms are small and very functional.  The lobby of the hotel is also too minimalistic. I remember this…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgarytraveller100
3,First stay since long renovation period —-some changes,bdw8285,I’ve stayed here many times and it’s definitely the preferred due to location. Its been my “go to”for years. It’s an expensive hotel especially during holidays and special events. Rooms are nice enough but nothing overboard. Fitness center quite nice. Front desk staff couldn’t have been nicer and as accommodating as possible. During the holidays they move concierge lounge to 5th floor to accommodate more people. Nice thought even if not as convenient. What is not good: on top of the high price they now charge a $25.00 destination fee and there is no choice. It’s said it’s to give discounts for tours and things. That’s ridiculous because not everyone wants to do a tour or have someone decide for them. They do give $15.00 discount off Bistro but don’t tell you what or where the…,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdw8285
3,Big Hotel in heart of Times Square,John K,"Stayed here for 7 nights recently and the location in Times Square is a positive if you like crowds and noise! The check in and out of the hotel was fast, efficient and the front desk staff were friendly.  The room itself on the 22nd floor was average with outdated carpets and furnishings but the beds were comfortable. Room was facing Times Square and I was still able to hear noise on the 22nd floor. I do have concerns about security in this large hotel, there were crowds of people entering the 1st floor lobby Day and night with anyone from the street able to access the hotel rooms on any floor from the elevators. Guests should have piece of mind with swipe access to the elevators but this did not exist. Most of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful but unfortunately the…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874johnk
3,New Year's 2020,Bob M,"Location is excellent as you have direct access to Grand Central Terminal and 7 blocks from Times Square.  The property is older and worn.  Rooms are pretty standard but bathrooms are European-style small.  Be prepared for waits with service as staff is few.  I would not consider this to be a ""Grand"" property in the style accustomed for Hyatt.  May have better valued options.  ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobmK2990DI
3,"Poor Room, good location",Michael G,Went to Hilton with family.  The lobby was nice.  The wait time to check in was absurd.  Took 45 minutes to check in.  Go to the city to sight see not wait on line.  Room was a decent size.  We had two double beds which was too small for me and my 6 year old daughter.  Couldn't they at least have queen beds?  The rug had a hole in it about the size of a quarter.  The bathroom was clean but the wallpaper was peeling in spots.  The best part of the hotel is the location.  Located 5 or 6 blocks from Central Park and 5 or 6 blocks from Time Square and the Theater district.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgB8860LJ
3,Just average but OK,Paul M,"The New York Hilton Midtown is a big intercity hotel located centrally just between the park and Time Square.  Because of its size, the reception reminded me of some of the big properties in Las Vegas but the difference in service is noticeable.  I arrived - there was no line for check-in. 4 were at the concierge, one receptionist helping a customer, and the rest of the area empty with one receptionist chatting to someone in the office.  It took a while (1-2 minutes) to notice that I was waiting.  I had checked in on line but she still had to process my keys. By comparison, my recent stays at Homewood suites (also Hilton branded) had my keys ready and I only needed to provide my ID and Credit Card.  I asked if upgrades were available - ""No"".  Difficult to believe but how would…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264PaulM
3,Very Business Orientated,Carol R,"We booked this hotel (as we had been to the one in South Korea and it was excellent), so we booked this one on December 2014. We stayed for 10 days, and we arrived, the room we booked the Grand Club type, when we checked in we were offered to upgrade again to a larger room at the cost of £300 for the 10 days, so we thought this was fine, because of the previous Hyatt we had stayed in was of similar room types. However the room we were given was a corner room, and it was spacious, but very cold, and the bathroom was so tiny you could not move around in. The air conditioning unit was constantly on, even when we turned up the heat,,,! We went to reception and complained, that we were not paying another £300 as this room was not worth it. they moved us to another room but again with…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolR26
3,"Noisy of course, and needs an update",dottie dog,"If you want to be right on top of the train station then it's perfect for you.  Even on the 31st floor I could hear the rumble of the trains at times.  The rooms are small. My first room was decent sized but the air conditioning didn't work and I was moved quickly. But the only available room left was quite small.  I would not have wanted to be overweight and try to navigate that bathroom.     The decor is black and silver - not an updated look.   It was fine, and generally clean.  The meeting rooms show the wear on the carpet and decor and really need that upgrade.  The hotel is very large and very busy.  But that is just the nature of being on top of grand central.     Staff were friendly and helpful.  It was fine, just a noisy place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dottiedog
3,Just Ok,James G,"I mean I thought being a Hilton we could expect better, not the case.  Hotel needs some help, old and tired. Rooms not cheap, location good, food good, rooms ok at best, small.  Hilton normally is ""Top Notch"" this one other than location was just ok. We had a power outage at the hotel while we stayed, not just Hilton most of mid town and I will say on a positive note staff did great for the most part.  I would have to see changes in order to stay at this Hilton again.  I do think with some focus on the details it can become as fantastic as it was in years gone by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2336XSjamesg
3,Better than last time,Michael S,"Hard to perfectly rate this one. If I could, a 3.5 this time. The positives are a brilliant location, a historical building, good staff and overall convenience. Cool and decent diner connected to it which is open 24/7. Useable business longue. Views were great. It is a perfectly fine hotel for shorter stays in my opinion. If you want to feel you are really on vacation, the high-volume of hotel traffic will not provide that feeling. Tons of rooms and 6 elevators! Takes a while to get up and down. Elevator guards to check your room key reminds you this is located in a busy place where you gotta keep an eye out for floaters and belongings. While I was appreciative of a penthouse upgrade (would def get this room again), the water pressure was low and drainage was horrible. Sadly not…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3512XMmichaels
3,Very disappointing,John B,"First our rooms were very small and very expensive for what we received. I also did not like the fact that they added on $25 a day for things we never used or cared about. Then they tried to sell us another upgrade of $25 a person a day for a drink and water at a  private area. I did however like their breakfast buffett. I also liked their central location. However, I'm becoming more and more disappointed in Hilton Honors status. It does not really mean much anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlewhitedog
3,"Great location, friendly staff, cleaned but bad sound insulation",Michael S,"The location of the hotel is perfect, there is a subway station right besides the main entrance and the Empire State Building is just a 10 minute walk away! The staff was very friendly and competent and was able to answer all our questions! The rooms are very clean, but also very small! For two people it is difficult to move around at the same time! The bathrooms should be updated, the porcelain plating came off of our bathtub and the heat adjustment of the water is still done with two separate leavers for hot and cold water!  The worst part about this hotel is the extremely bad noise insulation between the rooms! As soon as our neighbor used the toilet or the shower we woke up, because it was very noisy and we could hear everything in our room!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsK9897NY
3,The New Yorker Hotel,David S,"Great location, impressive period common areas were always very clean.  Rooms are small but not uncomfortably so.  Washrooms are in dire need of upgrade.  Tiles and fixtures appear to be original.  Wall tiles have been painted in an attempt to refresh, washroom fixtures are very old and worn.    If not for the washrooms I would have rated the rooms a 3.5. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2963FEdavids
3,Average Hotel - Typical Large Marriott,ATLTravelsALot,"This massive Marriott ""is-what-it-is"" - it serves it's purpose by being a landing spot for tourists and business people alike in the heart of Times Square - the hotel somewhat of a landmark now actually.  There is absolutely nothing outstanding about the hotel - nothing extremely positive and nothing extremely negative.  If you are looking for luxury, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for budget, go elsewhere.  But, if you are looking for a consistent Marriott experience where nothing is extraordinary and you get a good rate, stay here.  The views of Times Square from certain select rooms (you have to pay a premium for these and Times Square view rooms are clearly noted on the Marriott website and other booking sites) are perfect.  The bar/ lounge overlooking Times Square also…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATLTravelsALot
3,Great location in NYC,Anne D,Booked through Priceline and got a reasonable deal. Stayed here before and got a great room but unfortunately not this time. Room was clean but small and with no view and room was very dark. Suspect this was because we booked through Priceline. Checkin was slow and the lobby is under renovation. Still a good location in NYC.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeeLuv2Travel2
